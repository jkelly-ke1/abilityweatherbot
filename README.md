## How To Run 
If you want run this project on your own machine,
first of all you need to clone this repository and fill 'application.properties' file with your own data 
(PosgerSQL database config, Telegram bot API token and OpenWeather API token) and create database with 
particular table configuration: 
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_setting(
    id int PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
    telegram_user_id int,
    language_code varchar(100) NOT NULL,
    bot_language_code varchar(100) NOT NULL
);
```

## Also
All weather information provided by [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) API.
